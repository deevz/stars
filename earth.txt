Rewriting this as a list:
1- Life is sweet on this planet, but some citizens think that earth is such a letdown; that we should go somewhere else, uhu!
2- If you land on this planet, try having a coffee at Tim Horton's.
3- I think someone is deliberately creating conflicts. That's bad.
4- We have to find the vile fachists that are messing up Earth.
5- Life was better when it was only the dinosaurs in ozz :-)
6- A nice list, ein?  I would be nice to bring in some aliens.. ;-)
7- Maybe change the gravitational constant..  make everything heavier?
